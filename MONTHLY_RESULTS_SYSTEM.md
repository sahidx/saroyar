## 📊 Calculation Details

### Exam Average Calculation
```typescript
// Get all exams for the month
const examResults = await getMonthlyExams(studentId, year, month);

// Calculate percentage for each exam
let totalPercentage = 0;
let validExams = 0;

for (const exam of examResults) {
  if (exam.marksObtained !== null && exam.totalMarks > 0) {
    const percentage = (exam.marksObtained / exam.totalMarks) * 100;
    totalPercentage += percentage;
    validExams++;
  }
}

const average = validExams > 0 ? totalPercentage / validExams : 0;
```

### Attendance Calculation
```typescript
// Get attendance records for the month
const attendanceRecords = await getMonthlyAttendance(studentId, year, month);

let presentDays = 0;
for (const record of attendanceRecords) {
  if (record.isPresent) presentDays++;
}

// Calculate attendance percentage
const percentage = workingDays > 0 ? (presentDays / workingDays) * 100 : 0;
```

### Final Score Formula
```typescript
// Weighted calculation
const examWeight = 0.70;      // 70%
const attendanceWeight = 0.20; // 20%  
const bonusWeight = 0.10;      // 10%

const finalScore = Math.round(
  (examAverage * examWeight) + 
  (attendancePercentage * attendanceWeight) + 
  (bonusMarks * bonusWeight)
);
```

### Ranking Algorithm
```typescript
// Sort by final score (descending)
results.sort((a, b) => b.finalScore - a.finalScore);

// Assign ranks
results.forEach((result, index) => {
  result.rank = index + 1;
  result.totalStudents = results.length;
});
```
