## ðŸŽ¯ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

### 1. PostgreSQL Database Setup
```bash
# On VPS, install PostgreSQL
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

# Create database and user
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE coachmanager_dev;
CREATE USER coachmanager WITH PASSWORD 'secure123';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE coachmanager_dev TO coachmanager;
\q

# Update connection string in production .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://coachmanager:secure123@localhost:5432/coachmanager_dev
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```env
# Production .env file
